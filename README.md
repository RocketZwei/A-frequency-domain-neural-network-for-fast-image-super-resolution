# A-frequency-domain-neural-network-for-fast-image-super-resolution
This is the implementation of paper "A frequency domain neural network for fast image super-resolution".

File directory:
Network model implememtation:
cnn_fft_train.m     This file is for training a new network model.
cnn_init.m          The regular-net defined in here.
cnn_fft_test_regular_batch.m   This is the testing file for our model.

Hartely transformation:
hartleyTrans.m    Hartely transformation in 2D version.
hartleyTrans3D.m    Hartely transformation in 3D version.

Loss function:
vl_nnloss_l3.m     
vl_nnloss_sqrt.m
vl_nnloss_expl2.m
vl_nnloss_l2.m

Training data generation:
./generate_training_data/generate_aug_data.m

Testing data:
./testing/BSDS100
./testing/Set5
./testing/Set14
./testing/Set19

Testing code(Pre-processing, only for testing):
./testing_building_batch/imtobatch.m    To divid a testing image into several 360*480 batch. So that it can be process by network.
./testing_building_batch/batchtoim.m    To integate many 360*480 batchs into the original image.


Post-processing. Only for testing. (All the state of art in image super-resolution have this post-processing.)
modcrop.m    To crop and shave image when testing. 
shave.m    To crop and shave image when testing. 


Journal version's addition:
The below files are used in our Journal version, but not in the arKiv and conference version.
File directory:

cnn_init_equalnet.m   The equal-net defined in here.

HTmatrix.m   Compute the spatial kernel's frequency representation.
computeHT.m




Before runing the code. You need to first finish the compilation of MatConvNet. 
Do not re-download a new MatConvNet, since I have modified some files in the library. Directly run: "run matlab/vl_compilenn;" in the matlab will be enough. For more infomation about MatConvNet, please visit here: http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/


# MatConvNet: CNNs for MATLAB

**MatConvNet** is a MATLAB toolbox implementing *Convolutional Neural
Networks* (CNNs) for computer vision applications. It is simple,
efficient, and can run and learn state-of-the-art CNNs. Several
example CNNs are included to classify and encode images. Please visit
the [homepage](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet) to know more.

In case of compilation issues, please read first the
[Installation](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/install/) and
[FAQ](http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/faq/) section before creating an GitHub
issue. For general inquiries regarding network design and training
related questions, please use the
